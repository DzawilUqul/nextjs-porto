  description: "As a Teaching Assistant in the Game Division for BTNG 2024 at DNCC, I taught Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# and Unity Essentials to new students at Udinus. My role involved introducing core programming concepts, helping students understand how to structure their code using OOP principles, and guiding them through Unityâ€™s fundamental workflows. I also assisted students in troubleshooting their projects and applying best practices in game development. This experience allowed me to refine my teaching skills while supporting aspiring game developers in their learning journey.",
