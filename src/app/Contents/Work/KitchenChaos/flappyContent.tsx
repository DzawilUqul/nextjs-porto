    description: "I made this game from CodeMonkey Youtube channel tutorial. I learn how to make a 3D Top Down game where you play as a chef who has to cook and serve food to customers. I also learn how make my code cleaner, more readable, and still efficient. I learnt how to implement scriptable objects, events, and delegates. I also learn how to use Unityâ€™s built-in physics engine and animation to make the chef move and rotate.",
